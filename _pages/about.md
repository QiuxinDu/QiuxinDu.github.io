<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Master research student in the VR Lab at <a href="https://www.bit.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)</a>, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DCRUAmAAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Dongdong Weng</a>, majoring in Virtual Reality and Human-Computer Interaction. Meanwhile, I am a visiting student at the Institute of Human-Computer Interaction and Media Integration at <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Tsinghua University</a>, supervised by <a href="https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/ChunYu/" target="_blank">Prof. Chun Yu</a>. Prior to master, I obtained Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and technology at <a href="http://www.zzu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Zhengzhou University</a> in 2021.

I attended the HCIX Research Club and became a Research Assistant at the <a href="" target="_blank">APEX Lab of HKUST</a> led by <a href="" target="_blank">Prof. Mingming Fan</a>, independently supporting a HCI project. Before this, I was an intern in Light Illusions supervised by <a href="" target="_blank">Prof. Ping Tan</a> from June to August.

My current interest is how AI-powered VR can better improve human-computer interaction, especially in <strong>Human-AI Collaboration</strong>.
